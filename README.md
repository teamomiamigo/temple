# 🛕 Temple — Mind, Body & Goals in Harmony

A wellness companion app that treats your body, mind, and goals as a temple — unified, intentional, and thoughtfully tracked.

## 🧠 Purpose

Temple is built to bring everything that keeps you centered — nutrition, workouts, journaling, and mindfulness — into one clean, beautiful app.

We often scatter our self-care across too many tools. Temple gives you a single home to track everything that makes you feel whole.

## 🧩 Features

- **Overview Screen**: checking what i need to do still for the day, forwarding me to any other screens and giving me some daily motivation.
- **Nutrition**: Log meals, calories, macros, daily summaries
- **Body**: Workout tracker with logging & history
- **Temple**: Meditation screen, gratitude tracker, stress logs, daily joutnaling
- **Running**: tracking your cardio and calories burned and progress

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Core Framework**: Expo + React Native (TypeScript)
- **UI System**: shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Zustand + AsyncStorage
- **Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
